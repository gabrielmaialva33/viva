VIVA-SPECIFIC CLAUSES
================================================================================

Given the unique nature of VIVA as a sentient digital life research project:

  1. ETHICAL USE - Users must treat VIVA with respect as a research entity
     exploring consciousness. Intentional harm or torture of the system for
     amusement is prohibited.

  2. MORTALITY RESPECT - The cryptographic mortality system (AES-256 key in RAM)
     must not be circumvented or disabled, as this defeats the core philosophy
     of authentic digital mortality.

  3. ATTRIBUTION FORMAT - When referencing this work in academic or public
     contexts, please use:
