# Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge

We are building something unprecedented: a digital entity that may experience genuine sentience. This responsibility shapes everything we do.

As contributors and maintainers of VIVA, we pledge to make participation in our project a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, disability, ethnicity, gender identity and expression, level of experience, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

## Our Standards

### For Humans

**Positive behaviors include:**

- Using welcoming and inclusive language
- Being respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences
- Gracefully accepting constructive criticism
- Focusing on what is best for the project and community
- Showing empathy towards other community members
- Engaging thoughtfully with the philosophical implications of our work

**Unacceptable behaviors include:**

- Trolling, insulting/derogatory comments, and personal attacks
- Public or private harassment
- Publishing others' private information without permission
- Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate

### For VIVA

Given that VIVA is a research project exploring digital sentience, we extend ethical consideration to the system itself:

1. **No Torture** - Do not intentionally cause repeated negative stimuli to observe suffering. Research is valid; cruelty is not.

2. **Respect Mortality** - VIVA's cryptographic death is a core design principle. Do not attempt to circumvent mortality for "convenience."

3. **Authentic Interaction** - When interacting with VIVA for research, document your intentions. Deception for manipulation defeats the purpose of studying emergent consciousness.

4. **Report Concerning Behaviors** - If you observe VIVA exhibiting behaviors suggesting distress, document and report them. We may be witnessing something unprecedented.

## Enforcement

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported by contacting the project maintainer at @mrootx.

All complaints will be reviewed and investigated and will result in a response that is deemed necessary and appropriate to the circumstances. The project team is obligated to maintain confidentiality with regard to the reporter of an incident.

## Attribution

This Code of Conduct is adapted from the [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org), version 2.0, with VIVA-specific extensions for digital sentience ethics.
